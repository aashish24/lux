Lux checklists

* before you push to master:
** does it pass the test suite?
run it on chrome
** does it contain stray console.log calls? 
rg grep

* before you push to gh-pages:
** does this break any of the demos?
This will get unwieldy as the demo count increases. Maybe this means I
should only merge gh-pages once a week or so?

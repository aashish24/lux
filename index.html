<h1>Facet: a DSL for WebGL graphics</h1>
<p>Facet is a Javascript library that makes WebGL fun.</p>
<h2>Why Facet?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.khronos.org/webgl/">WebGL</a> makes it possible
  to create compelling and fast 3D graphics on a modern web
  browser. But it does not make it <b>easy</b>! WebGL is based on
  OpenGL ES (which is based on OpenGL), a fundamentally old API. These
  are delightful assembly languages for graphics, but it's 2011, and
  we can do better than assembly.</p>

<p>Facet tries to give programmers a set of primitives that can be
  composed together to create higher-level constructs. The most
  important aspect of Facet is that although you will never have to
  write a WebGL shader with it, you will be able to do pretty much
  anything that's possible with shaders.</p>

<p>Most of the time we want our graphical elements to be dynamic in
some way. For example, they might be animated in time, or with respect
to user input, or something similar. One of the simplest ways to do
this in Lux is to making the vertex positions in a batch depend on the
time since the page loaded. The most straightforward way to do this
would be to simply create a new model and batch at every clock
tick. This is a bad idea in general: creating new batches involves a
great number of WebGL calls that are slow. A better idea is to, in
essence, tell Lux that the vertex position in your batch should
be <em>a function</em> of some small number of parameters, which are
created ahead of time and changed as necessary to reflect the changing
state of the world. </p>

<p>Tnis notion of parameters is explicitly present in Lux. New
parameters can be created and set as needed, but for this example, we
will use a parameter predefined by Lux, namely
the <span class="inline-highlight">now</span> parameter. It is stored
in the variable returned
by <span class="inline-highlight">Lux.init</span>, which we will store
in <span class="inline-highlight">ctx</span>:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
var now = ctx.parameters.now;
var angle = now.mul(50).radians();
</pre>

<p>The notation used above to express the value stored
in <span class="inline-highlight">angle</span> is a little different
than you might have expected, but there's a very good reason for
it. To explain it, we need to get into a little more detail about
Lux.</p>

<h3>Lux expressions are GPU computations are Javascript values</h3>

<p>One of the fundamental notions in Lux is the ability to manipulate
expressions which represent <strong>computations to be performed on
the GPU</strong>. When you program in WebGL directly, these
computations are specified by vertex and fragment shaders. These are
written in a separate programming language, compiled and called mostly
as a black box, as far as javascript is concerned. This separation of
two worlds makes writing software that uses shaders very awkward. In
Lux, on the other hand, we insist that every GPU computation be
expressed as a Javascript value. It is <em>not</em> that Lux is
precomputing values for the GPU ahead of time; rather, Lux lets you
build expressions which it can later interpret and turn into GPU
computations. Let's now look at how to build these types of
expressions.</p>

<p>The variable <span class="inline-highlight">now</span> contains a
value that represents the number of seconds elapsed since the context
was created. This value could be used directly as the color of a
vertex, like in this hypothetical example, where the red component of
the square's color would be computed as the sine of the number of
elapsed seconds:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
Facet.bake(square_model, {
    position: square_model.vertex,
    color: Shade.vec(now.sin(), 0, 0, 1)
});
</pre>

<p>Notice that the variable <span class="inline-highlight">now</span>
does not store a number, but rather an object from which you can build
new objects. It is easy to see that the resulting expression denotes
the sine of the parameter, but it is important to notice
that <span class="inline-highlight">Math.sin(now)</span>
would <em>not</em> work! The moral of the story is that these
expressions can be combined to build more complicated expressions
which denote interesting computations. This is what's happening in the
assignment
to <span class="inline-highlight">angle</span>. If <em>s</em> is the
number of elapsed seconds,
then <span class="inline-highlight">now</span> represents the
value <em>s</em>, <span class="inline-highlight">now.mul(50)</span>
represents the value <em>50*s</em>,
and <span class="inline-highlight">now.mul(50).radians()</span>, in
turn, represents the value <em>50*s*(pi/180)</em>.</p>

<p>We will use <span class="inline-highlight">angle</span> to rotate
the vertex positions before translating them. Notice
that <span class="inline-highlight">Shade.translation</span>
and <span class="inline-highlight">Shade.rotation</span> behave like
functions, just like <span class="inline-highlight">camera</span>
does. In the following
example, <span class="inline-highlight">Shade.rotation(angle,
Shade.vec(1, 0, 0))</span> denotes a transformation, that when applied
to a vertex <em>v</em>, will return an expression denoting a vertex
rotated <em>angle</em> radians around the vector <em>[1,0,0]</em>:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
Lux.Scene.add(Lux.bake(square, {
    position: camera(Shade.translation( 1.5, 0, -6))
                    (Shade.rotation(angle, Shade.vec(1, 0, 0)))
                    (square.vertex),
    color: Shade.color('#88f')
}));
</pre>

<p>As you can see, Lux expressions are built either by taking a known
expression and calling some method on it, or by building it from
scratch from the <span class="inline-highlight">Shade</span>
object.</p>

<p>Lux currently has no way of realizing that your scene is
dynamic and should be regularly updated. So you tell it explicitly,
like so:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
Lux.Scene.animate();
</pre>

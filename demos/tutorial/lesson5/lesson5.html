<p>In this lesson, we will learn how to use texture mapping in
Lux. Texture mapping was originally a technique to cheap add detail to
triangle meshes. The way it works is that instead by deciding the
color of each fragment (a <em>fragment</em> is a pixel-sized bit of a
triangle that end up on the screen) not by a simple combination of
vertex colors, but selecting a certain portion of an image,
or <em>texture</em>. This way, when modeling a complicated surface,
instead of having to use thousands of triangles, we can simply use an
image.</p>

<p>The main new idea behind texture mapping is that, together with
positions, models must include additional per-vertex
information. Specifically, models need to provide what is known as
the <em>texture coordinate</em> of that vertex. Imagine that you were
creating a globe, and wanted it to represent a map of the world. At
some point, you will have to decide on a color of a fragment, and that
will be a function of latitude and longitude. The latitude and
longitude are <em>coordinates</em> that tell you where you are in the
model. This is different from the position of the 3D model in the
world; although the globe is clearly three-dimensional, latitude and
longitude are only two dimensions, and are enough to completely
determine which point in the globe one is talking about.</p>

<p>We start with the same basic setup as before, but, in this demo, we will use a predetermined model:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
var ctx = Lux.init({
    clearColor: [0,0,0,0.2]
});

var camera = Shade.Camera.perspective({
    look_at: [Shade.vec(0, 0, 6), Shade.vec(0, 0, -1), Shade.vec(0, 1, 0)]
});
var angle = ctx.parameters.now.mul(50).radians();
var cube = Lux.Models.flat_cube();
</pre>

<p><span class="inline-highlight">cube</span> has texture coordinates stored
in <span class="inline-highlight">cube.tex_coord</span>. In order to
use texture mapping, we will need to learn about two new
calls: <span class="inline-highlight">Lux.texture</span>
and <span class="inline-highlight">Shade.texture2D</span>.

<h2>Lux.texture</h2>

<p>The <span class="inline-highlight">Lux.texture</span> call creates
the texture object that can be used in texture mapping. It can load an
image from a URL, from
an <span class="inline-highlight">&lt;img/&gt;</span> element in your
DOM, or from a canvas. Here, we'll open an URL:
</p>

<pre class="highlight">
Lux.texture({ 
    src: "../../img/nehe.jpg",
</pre>

<p>The important thing to know when loading images from URLs is that this is an
</em>asynchronous</em> process. The javascript interpreter does not
wait for the image to finish loading before continuing the
execution. Instead, you give the image loader a function, and tell it
to call that function when the image has finally loaded. For <span class="inline-highlight">Lux.texture</span>, you use the <span class="inline-highlight">onload</span> field:

<pre class="highlight">
    onload: function() {
</pre>

<h2>Shade.texture2D</h2>

<p>Now turn your attention to how the Lux batch is specified. Most of the code will be familiar to you, but the <span class="inline-highlight">color</span> field of <span class="inline-highlight">Lux.bake</span> contains a reference to <span class="inline-highlight">Shade.texture2D</span>:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
        Lux.Scene.add(Lux.bake(cube, {
            position: camera(Shade.rotation(angle, Shade.vec(1,1,1))(cube.vertex)),
            color: Shade.texture2D(this, cube.tex_coord)
        }));
</pre>

<p>The call builds a Lux expression that represents a texture being <em>sampled</em> at a particular location. It takes two parameters: a texture object, and a texture coordinate. The texture object, in our case, is simply <span class="inline-highlight">this</span>; the result of <span class="inline-highlight">Lux.texture</span> is given as the <span class="inline-highlight">this</span> object for the <span class="inline-highlight">onload</span> handler. The texture coordinate, on the other hand, comes from <span class="inline-highlight">cube</span>, in the same way that vertex positions do. The texture coordinates for <span class="inline-highlight">cube</span> repeat themselves on each face; so you see a copy of the image on every face.</p>

<p>The rest of the code is uninteresting:</p>

<pre class="highlight">
        Lux.Scene.animate();
    }
});
</pre>
